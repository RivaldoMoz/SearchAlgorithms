# This repo contains different search Algoritms used in AI

 - [x] Breadth First Search Algorithm 
 - [x] Depth First Search Algorithm
 - [x] A* Path Finding Algorithm
 - [x] Best First Search Algorithm

This algorithm are implemented in Python and displaying ad Generating mazes using [Pymaze](https://github.com/MAN1986/pyamaze/)
All the algorithms in the root folder are using a simple function taking  one parameter (maze) and returning its forward path.

# Demo with Search Path Implementation

All this algorithm will be extended to show the maze Search Path, Reverse and Forward Path
